This is a Phoenix backend that provides a REST-ful API and renders a React frontend.

#Install

Follow the Phoenix installation guide to get Erlang (runtime), Elixir
(language), and finally Phoenix (framework) installed.

http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/installation

#Build

Run a Phoenix dev server with `mix phoenix.server` and it will watch for
changes to both the Phoenix and React components and re-render them.

#Other Info
`npm run lint` - runs linting with a simple set of style guidelines/rules

Notes:
- starting out with a web form to enter survey results about different whiskeys
    - data should be stored to a database (see diagram)
- some way to view the data would be cool too

    - might be useful for the forms
